We implemented a user friendly Shell that lets the user encrypt or decrypt any message they want with simple and straightforward commands.
Simply run Main.java and you will be greeted with a Welcome message and easy to follow instructions.
We implemented 3 commands, Help, Encrypt and Decrypt.
Just type in 'Help' to display all available commands.
You can type in 'Encrypt' or 'Decrypt', to start the encryption or decryption process, then follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with your encryption/decryption.
You can encrypt using 5 different methods that you get to choose from: Caesar, Vigenere, Xor, Onetime and Cbc.
You can decrypt using 3 different methods that you get to choose from: Caesar, Vigenere and Xor.

We hope you enjoy Shell :)
